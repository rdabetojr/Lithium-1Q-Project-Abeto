            <h2>The Philippines education system still faces significant challenges, despite the ongoing reforms these
                past years. Some students reportedly have a high rate of illiteracy and poor fundamental skills.
                Particularly in rural areas, where there is a lack of basic utilities such as electricity and potable
                water, and proper instructional materials are in short supply. Furthermore, students perform poorly in
                international assessments like the PISA and TIMSS, which indicate the problems of education in our
                country. The following are the major difficulties encountered by the country's educational system.</h2>

                overcrowded classrooms, and a lack of learning materials. These factors affect a student's academic
                performance, limiting their opportunities for economic advancements and social mobility.</h3>
